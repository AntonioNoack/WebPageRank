	  **PageRank & HITS Calculator**
      For your data science needs
	 
The program can be found [here](calc).
	
About 
==============
I, Antonio Noack, am a computer science student from Jena, Germany. I intend to study Computational and Data Science after I finished my bachelor thesis in the area of the Semantic Web.

When looking for a good online tool to calculate [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) and [HITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm) scores for my thesis example, I found a nice program, however without settings, for PageRank, and none for HITS.
Since both are relatively easy to calculate, I wrote my own website for that.

The program is [OpenSource](https://github.com/AntonioNoack/WebPageRank), and can be modified for your needs, thanks to the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)">Apache 2.0 License</a> :).

Data Import
==============
You can create graphs in two ways: either drag nodes, and connect them, and such, or you can upload a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file containing the data. Do give you examples, you can export to JSON as well.

Format
--------------
The JSON data is a JSON object containing two fields, similar to the graph definition of G = (V, E).

Vertices(V)
--------------
The first field, an array, describes the vertices. It's called "vertices".

Each node/vertex can have a name ("name"), and stored values for PageRank (property "pr"), and HITS (properties "hub" + "auth" for hub and auth-scores).
Additionally, the properties x, y, backgroundColor, and textColor are used for the visuals.

Edges (E)
--------------
The second field is the edges, called "edges".
They are encoded as a list of triples (an array each).
Each triple has the following structure: 

`````````json
[
	"index of from-vertex",
	"index of to-vertex",
	"weight"
]
`````````

e.g.

`````````json
[
	0,
	1, 
	0.5
]
`````````

for an edge from the first node to the second, with a weight of 0.5.

If the weight property is missing, it's assumed to be 1.

Example
----------------
`````````json
{
	"vertices": [
		{
			"name": "Node 0, first",
			"x": 0, "y": 0,
			"pr": 0.5,
			"hub": 1,
			"auth": 2
		},
		{
			"name": "Node 1, second",
			"x": 3, "y": 0,
		}
	],
	"edges": [
		[0,1,1]
	]
}
`````````

Additionally, the data can be passed as a link argument ("data").

The program, with the example passed as argument, is [here](https://phychi.com/pagerank/calc?data=eyJlIjpbWzAsMSwxXV0sInYiOltbIk5vZGUgMCwgZmlyc3QiLDAsMF0sWyJOb2RlIDEsIHNlY29uZCIsMywwXV19).

In this case, a compressed JSON representation is used, which then is encoded to [Base 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64). In this representation, the "vertices" attribute is called "v", the "edge" attribute is called "e", and all vertices are encoded as an array, with the contents Name, X-Coordinate, Y-Coordinate instead of an object. This makes URLs shorter. The usual way to get a short URL for your needs is to use the field "Share your graph" in the program controls on the left.

This is the compressed version as JSON:
`````````json
{
	"e":[
		[0, 1, 1]
	],
	"v":[
		["Node 0, first", 0, 0],
		["Node 1, second", 3, 0]
	]
}
`````````
where then all white-space is removed, and the Base 64 encoding is applied. This result in the following string:
`````````base64
eyJlIjpbWzAsMSwxXV0sInYiOltbIk5vZGUgMCwgZmlyc3QiLDAsMF0sWyJOb2RlIDEsIHNlY29uZCIsMywwXV19
`````````
The resulting link is [https://phychi.com/pagerank/calc?data=eyJlIjpbWzAsMSwxXV0sInYiOltbIk5vZGUgMCwgZmlyc3QiLDAsMF0sWyJOb2RlIDEsIHNlY29uZCIsMywwXV19](https://phychi.com/pagerank/calc?data=eyJlIjpbWzAsMSwxXV0sInYiOltbIk5vZGUgMCwgZmlyc3QiLDAsMF0sWyJOb2RlIDEsIHNlY29uZCIsMywwXV19).
